## Vampire Avoiding Sunlit Windows Game
Hosted on https://sierramoore.github.io/vampire-game/

### What is this?
#### This is a 2D Canvas Game avoiding obstacle game, set in the side perspective
moving to the right. The goal is to last as long as you can avoiding windows,
as they will quickly decrease your health. The further you make it the higher score you'll get.

### Why Did I make this?
#### This is my first project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.
I decided to make a game similar to a helicopter obstacle game I used to play as a kid.
I went with a vampire avoiding sunny windows because when I thought it silly and unordinary.
I have more ideas I would like to come back to later to implement like:
* Townspeople throwing garlic at the vampire to keep him avoiding more objects
* Having a certain few Townspeople the vampire can suck blood from to increase his health
* Having dark windows that would not effect the vampires health to confuse the player

#### What did I learn in the process?
This was my first time using Canvas and through making this game learned a lot about
manipulating objects on screen, animation, and collision detection. My proudest achievement was figuring out how to make the
background image appear to move with the animation frame of canvas to feel the motion of the game.
